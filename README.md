**RSpec::FileSystem** provides a rich and comprehensive suite of RSpec matchers for
testing file system structures.

Verifying that a generator, build script, or any file-manipulating process has
produced the correct output can be tedious and verbose. This gem makes those
assertions simple, declarative, and easy to read, allowing you to describe an entire
file tree and its properties within your specs.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the value this API provides over what is available in standard
RSpec.

### 1. Abstraction and Readability: From Imperative to Declarative

    Standard RSpec forces you to describe *how* to test something. This API allows you
    to declaratively state *what* the system should look like.

    Without this API (Imperative Style):

    ```ruby
    # This code describes the HOW: stat the file, get the mode, convert to octal...
    # It's a script, not a specification.
    path = '/var/www/html/index.html'
    expect(File.exist?(path)).to be true
    expect(File.stat(path).mode.to_s(8)[-4..]).to eq('0644')
    expect(File.stat(path).owned?).to be true # This just checks if UID matches script runner
    ```

    With this API (Declarative Style):

    ```ruby
    # This code describes the WHAT. The implementation details are hidden.
    # It reads like a specification document.
    expect('/var/www/html').to have_file('index.html', mode: '0644', owner: 'httpd')
    ```

    This hides the complex, imperative logic inside the matcher and exposes a clean,
    readable, domain-specific language (DSL).

### 2. Conciseness and Cohesion: Grouping Related Assertions

    Without this API, testing multiple attributes of a single file requires
    fragmented, repetitive `expect` calls. Your API groups these assertions into one
    cohesive, logical block.

    Without this API:

    ```ruby
    path = '/var/data/status.json'
    expect(File.file?(path)).to be true
    expect(File.size(path)).to be > 0
    expect(File.read(path)).not_to include('error')
    expect(JSON.parse(File.read(path))['status']).to eq('complete')
    ```

    With this API:

    ```ruby
    expect('/var/data').to have_file('status.json',
      size: be > 0,
      content: not(/error/),
      json_content: include('status' => 'complete')
    )
    ```

    This is far easier to read and maintain because all the assertions about
    `status.json` are in one place.

### 3. The Nested Directory DSL Adds to the Expressive Power

    This is where this API provides something that base RSpec simply cannot do
    elegantly. Describing the state of a directory tree with standard RSpec is
    incredibly verbose and difficult to read.

    Without this API:

    ```ruby
    # This is hard to read and mentally parse.
    dir_path = '/etc/service/nginx'
    expect(Dir.exist?(dir_path)).to be true
    expect(File.exist?(File.join(dir_path, 'run'))).to be true
    expect(Dir.exist?(File.join(dir_path, 'log'))).to be true
    expect(File.exist?(File.join(dir_path, 'down'))).to be false
    ```

    With this API:

    ```ruby
    # This is a clear, hierarchical specification of the directory's contents.
    expect('/etc/service').to have_dir('nginx') do
      file('run')
      dir('log')
      no_file('down')
    end
    ```

    The nested block is a leap in expressiveness and power, allowing you to write
    complex integration and infrastructure tests with ease.

### 4. Descriptive and Intelligible Failure Messages

    When a complex, nested expectation fails, this gem pinpoints the exact failure,
    saving you valuable debugging time.

    **Standard RSpec Failure:**

    ```
    expected: true
         got: false
    ```

    This kind of message forces you to manually inspect the file system to understand
    what went wrong.

    **With this API:**

    You get a detailed, hierarchical report that shows the full expectation and
    clearly marks what failed.

    ```
    the entry 'my-app' at '/tmp/d20250622-12345-abcdef' was expected to satisfy the following but did not:
    - have directory "config" containing:
      - have file "database.yml" with owner "db_user" and mode "0600"
        - expected owner to be "db_user", but was "root"
        - expected mode to be "0600", but was "0644"
    ```

## Installation

Add this line to your application's `Gemfile` in the `:test` or `:development` group:

```ruby
group :test, :development do
  gem 'rspec-file_system'
end
```

And then execute:

```bash
$ bundle install
```

Or install it yourself as:

```bash
$ gem install rspec-file_system
```

## Setup

Require the gem in your `spec/spec_helper.rb` file:

```ruby
# spec/spec_helper.rb
require 'rspec/file_system'
```

## Usage & Examples

All matchers operate on a base path, making your tests clean and portable.

### Basic Assertions

At its simplest, you can check for the existence of files and directories.

```ruby
it "creates the basic structure" do
  # Setup: Create some files and directories in our temp dir
  FileUtils.mkdir_p(File.join(@tmpdir, "app/models"))
  FileUtils.touch(File.join(@tmpdir, "config.yml"))

  # Assertions
  expect(@tmpdir).to have_file("config.yml")
  expect(@tmpdir).to have_dir("app")
  expect(@tmpdir).not_to have_file("database.yml")
end
```

### Negative Assertions (Checking for Absence)

You can use `not_to` to ensure that a file, directory, or symlink of a specific
type does not exist.

- `not_to have_file` passes if the entry is a directory, a symlink, or non-existent.
- `not_to have_dir` passes if the entry is a file, a symlink, or non-existent.
- `not_to have_symlink` passes if the entry is a file, a directory, or non-existent.

**Important:** Negative matchers cannot be given options (`:mode`, `:content`, etc.)
or blocks.

```ruby
it "can check for the absence of entries" do
  # Setup
  Dir.mkdir(File.join(@tmpdir, "existing_dir"))
  File.write(File.join(@tmpdir, "existing_file.txt"), "content")

  # Assert that a path that doesn't exist fails all checks
  expect(@tmpdir).not_to have_file("non_existent.txt")
  expect(@tmpdir).not_to have_dir("non_existent_dir")
  expect(@tmpdir).not_to have_symlink("non_existent_link")

  # Assert that an existing directory is NOT a file or symlink
  expect(@tmpdir).not_to have_file("existing_dir")
  expect(@tmpdir).not_to have_symlink("existing_dir")
  # expect(@tmpdir).not_to have_dir("existing_dir") # This would fail

  # Assert that an existing file is NOT a directory or symlink
  expect(@tmpdir).not_to have_dir("existing_file.txt")
  expect(@tmpdir).not_to have_symlink("existing_file.txt")
  # expect(@tmpdir).not_to have_file("existing_file.txt") # This would fail
end
```

### File Content Assertions

Go beyond existence and inspect what's inside a file.

```ruby
before do
  File.write(File.join(@tmpdir, "app.log"), "INFO: User logged in\nWARN: Low disk space")
  File.write(File.join(@tmpdir, "config.json"), '{"theme":"dark","version":2}')
  FileUtils.touch(File.join(@tmpdir, "empty.file"))
end

it "validates file content" do
  # Check for content with a string or regex
  expect(@tmpdir).to have_file("app.log", content: "INFO: User logged in")
  expect(@tmpdir).to have_file("app.log", content: /WARN:.*space/)

  # Check for the absence of content
  expect(@tmpdir).to have_file("app.log", content: not(/ERROR/))

  # Check if a file is empty
  expect(@tmpdir).to have_file("empty.file", size: 0)

  # Check for valid JSON and match its structure
  expect(@tmpdir).to have_file("config.json", json_content: {
    "theme" => "dark",
    "version" => an_instance_of(Integer)
  })
end
```

### Attribute Assertions

You can chain assertions to verify file metadata like permissions, ownership, size,
and symlinks.

```ruby
before do
  # Create a script, a secret key, and a symlink
  script_path = File.join(@tmpdir, "deploy.sh")
  File.write(script_path, "#!/bin/bash\n...")
  FileUtils.chmod(0755, script_path)

  key_path = File.join(@tmpdir, "secret.key")
  File.write(key_path, "KEY_DATA")
  FileUtils.chmod(0600, key_path)

  FileUtils.ln_s("deploy.sh", File.join(@tmpdir, "latest_script"))
end

it "validates file attributes" do
  # A single file can have many attributes checked at once
  expect(@tmpdir).to have_file("deploy.sh", mode: "0755", size: be > 10)

  # On Unix systems, you can check ownership
  current_user = Etc.getlogin
  expect(@tmpdir).to have_file("secret.key", owner: current_user, mode: "0600")

  # Check symlinks and their targets
  expect(@tmpdir).to have_symlink("latest_script", target: "deploy.sh")
end
```

### Directory Structure Assertions

This is the most powerful feature. Use `have_dir` with a block to describe and verify
an entire file tree.

```ruby
before do
  # Generate a complex directory structure
  app_dir = File.join(@tmpdir, "my-app")
  FileUtils.mkdir_p(File.join(app_dir, "bin"))
  FileUtils.mkdir_p(File.join(app_dir, "config"))
  FileUtils.mkdir_p(File.join(app_dir, "log"))

  File.write(File.join(app_dir, "bin/run"), "#!/bin/bash")
  FileUtils.chmod(0755, File.join(app_dir, "bin/run"))

  File.write(File.join(app_dir, "config/database.yml"), "adapter: postgresql")
  FileUtils.ln_s("database.yml", File.join(app_dir, "config/db.yml"))
end

it "validates a nested directory structure" do
  expect(@tmpdir).to have_dir("my-app") do
    # Assert on the 'bin' directory and its contents
    dir "bin" do
      file "run", mode: "0755", content: /bash/
    end

    # Assert on the 'config' directory and its contents
    dir "config" do
      file "database.yml"
      symlink "db.yml", target: "database.yml"
    end

    # Assert that the 'log' directory is present and empty
    dir "log"
  end
end
```
